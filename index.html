   <p>Four friends from Leeds, UK came together in 2007 to form the band ΔAlt-J. Their name comes from the Greek letter "delta", whihc is used as a mathematical symbol for change but they pronounche it Alt-J because pressing Alt+J on a Mac computer gets you the delta symbol (Δ). They are among many musical genres indie pop being among one of them. Their sound is not like most of the songs you here today, it's very serene and soothing to listen to. Since 2007, Alt-J has come out with 4 albums. I came across thme one day when I was listening to a playlist on Pandora. The song that played was Breezeblocks. I just loved how smooth their voices were and the soft rhythym of the song. After that I got all 4 of their albums and I listen to their music everyday. Not a lot of people know about them and I wish they did because they're music is just so different from what you might here everyday. </p>
